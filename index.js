// Compare the results when traveling at an average of 55, 60, and 75 miles per hour. Which makes the most sense for the trip? 
// Answer: It depends on the user, if they prefer less time traveled even if the amount is still within budget. For purposes of providing an answer I think 60mph makes most sense interms of a medium between time spent traveling and cost of travel.
